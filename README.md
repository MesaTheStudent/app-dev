## This repository will showcase my favorite series/movies and what I loved about them!

### The first series that I would love to showcase would be **Dragon Ball**!

What makes **Dragon Ball** so fascinating for me is the fact that Goku is a character whose whole life was trained in martial arts. He is a person whose entire life is devoted to protecting his family and saving the world multiple times by eliminating and defeating enemies such as _Freeza_, the _androids_, and the _Perfect Cell_. No matter what obstacle he faces, he essentially fights with every inch of his life, no matter how big the power gap between him and the enemy is.

Personally, for me my favorite characters (not in order) would be:
- _Perfect Cell_
- _Freeza_
- _Android 19_
- _General Blue_
- _Goku_

### The second series that I love just as much as **Dragon Ball** would be **Naruto**!

**Naruto** is an anime series that has a _special place in my heart_. When I was a child, I was constantly excited to watch a new episode on my television and was always so happy when I saw Naruto beating new enemies that were stronger and overcoming them, or Sasuke creating new jutsus that would quite literally destroy entire mountains. But my most favorite character out of everyone in the Naruto series would probably be Madara. Madara is a character who is my all-time favorite, not only in Naruto but in all of the anime series that i watched, this is because when the plot was being shown in Naruto, Madara suddenly destroyed everyone who was considered strong in the series and humiliated them. Madara also beat every single enemy with ease, with the exception of **Hashirama**.

My favorite characters (in order) in Naruto would be:
1. _Madara_
2. _Sasuke_
3. _Naruto_
4. _Neji_
5. _Might Guy_

**HunterxHunter** is an anime series that I would also like to showcase. What makes it so good is that it subverts expectations. You expect that the series will make the main characters invincible, just like any other shounen. But by the end of the anime, you find out that no matter how strong the characters get, they have their limits. Another way that the anime subverted my expectations would be how the main characters, who are supposedly the **good guys, lost their humanity**, while the villains became more human and kind over time.

My favorite characters in HunterxHunter would be:
1. _Gon_
2. _Killua_
3. _Leorio and Kurapika_
4. _Isaac Netero_
5. _Hisoka Morow_
